## Shopping Goals

What should I be thinking about when thinking about shopping food?

Concentrate on ingredients that are:

* Readily available, reasonably priced
* Fresh, organic, without additives
* Low sodium, high protein

Ingredients or products available at my local Safeway (or by Safeway delivery).

Shop every two or three days (my local Safeway is across the street).

Food should be from the outside walls of the supermarket - fresh and perishable.

Everything is eaten. No food is thrown away.


## Hints

* Look at the expiry dates
* Look at the nutrition infobox of everything
	* Check number of servings per packet
	* Salt is the usual worst culprit followed by sugar
* Carry a market bag
* Order online and go to the store. Both are good
* Short frequent trips to the market - helps with getting more walking
* Deli products have no nutrition info
