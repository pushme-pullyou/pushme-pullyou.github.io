The text messages are lightweight. On one hand they seem to talk to people that have a lot of time on their hands, like to go shopping, take pleasure in preparing complex meals. On the other hand the messages seem to talk to people who have not put a lot of thought into what they actually eat.


Where are the links to cool papers by learned food peeps? Or web sites that provide useful diet stats and facts. Where are pointers to commercial products that are actually OK to eat? 


It might be better if the messages were better targeted to various audience type: living with others or living alone. Have time to cook or don't have time. Meat & potatoes or vegan & vegan. And so on. And there should be a way of seeing all the messages that have been sent.

Filling out my track succeed spreadsheet is not working out really well. It's too boring to want to do,

Yes, I could add subtotals which might make things look more interesting. but I live on numbers. I 'see' the whole sheet and subtotals distract in many ways. Ditto coloring the numbers if I hit a target << I should do this anyway. Done

I should build an app and have a $40 Amazon tablet in the kitchen just for adding what I eat.

Are nitrites getting a bad rap

Several processed meat vendors sell products with no nitrites. Photo of th back of a Columbus Pepper Turkey package:  [columbus-pepper-turkey.jpg]( columbus-pepper-turkey.jpg ).

Advertise 5,000,000 food items

A search for 'Green Giant Steamers Healthy Vision' gives 10,000 nearly duplicate results. I did not find one with correct product information.

Suggestion

All foods should have an internationally recognized bar code, qr code, and ID number

Web sites provide pertinent data for the IDs

Web sites are provided by producers, organizations, private peeps whatever. The key thing

Doh! every product has a UPC!

Using Google, After several false leads, wow.

Need to build a spreadsheet or something where

One worksheet allows entry of UPC - which then goes and fetches data
Second worksheet allows daily entry of data with a few clicks per item


cereal + salsa - 1/2 veg 1 grain
healthy vision = 2 veg
brown rice = 3 grain
guacamole = 1 veg
carrots = 1 veg
salad + salsa = 2 veg
nuts 3 oz?
