Ladybug Web Coding Style
===

### Mission

<!-- * Fabricate free, fast, fun fantasies -->
* Write cookbook scripts that are ready to use, cut and paste
* Build engineering tools built to solve specific problems 
* Develop skills you can use everywhere
* You can download a script easily and when you click it, it should just work.
	* Everything you need to know about a script is in one place and written in the same way.
* Ready to use, cut and paste scripts
* Built to solve specific problems in a single programming language - JavaScript
* Small easy-to-understand scripts that you can use to hack your own apps
* All written in JavaScript
	* Even the HTML and CSS is created and edited using JavaScript.
	* Experimental techniques designed to get you coding faster but documented
* Built to fork edit and share - all FOSS in GitHub
* For STEM peeps - not 'full-stack programmers'
* Explore new ways of visualizing in 3D - use the graphics processing units (GPUs ) to their maximum


For much more detail about the coding style you can have a look at the [Jaanga Practice Notes]( http://jaanga.github.io/documents/jaanga-practice-notes/#code-mission-vision-r1.md )
Some of the notes there could come here as and when there is agreement on the good styles for this effort.

### Vision

* If the mundane engineering tasks become easy, inexpensive and swift to carry out, 
then possibilities arise for the more complex, sophisticated and even extravagant ideas to turn into realities
* RIP Zaha Hadid. Let us continue to design with your disruptive yet aways elegant spirit

<!--
Everything is in between two `<script>` tags and written JavaScript

What does mean?

There are no black boxes - with things in other places - that you never look at.

Instead of a huge file of opaque CSS rules that are mostly never invoked, there's half a dozen rules just for the script in play
