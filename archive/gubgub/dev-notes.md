* Looking at http://material.io and Material Design literal
    * Seems much more up my alley than Boootstrap
    * Very simple dependencies
    * And only need to add class names
* Thinking about splitting into GubGub and Dab-Dab
    * One for exploring and one for Monitoring
* Thinking about turning menu choices into radio buttons



2016-11-02
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* R2 moving along nicely
* Seem to have cleaned-up most of the multiple load issues
* Lesson learned: All location hash updates should be in the html

R2 Started. Nice message from Mostapha. Will build Ladybug version

Cleaning up code on R2

Two Reddit up votes. 4 Twitter hearts. No replies from Paul or Geoff. Reply from Tania saying 'It's Greek to me.

So what to do next?

Mostapha and Lindsay Kaye?

## [Jaanga GubGub R1]( https://jaanga.github.io/gubgub/ )

### [README]( https://jaanga.github.io/gubgub/#README.md )

### Concept

Explore and monitor the <a href="https://github.com/about" target="_blank" >many GitHub projects</a>
helped by the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/" target="_blank" >GitHub API</a> and client-side cookbook JavaScript.

### Features

* Select or edit GitHub API search queries
* Select results to view from list of users - or add your own user
* Display and compare GitHub responses in many different ways
* 100% client-side - host on GitHub Pages - no server needed
* Coded throughout with entry-level JavaScript

### Bigger Picture

GubGub is a preliminary, somewhat clumsy effort to help you with the following thoughts:

* The code you write markets the code that sells the code you write
* If you live for the joy of coding then your code should support a lifestyle you enjoy
* Building FOSS - like practicing law or medicine - is not the route to billions of dollars but may be a route to a comfortable lifestyle
