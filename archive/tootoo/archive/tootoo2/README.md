TooToo2 Read Me
===
_Browse and view files on GitHub with remarkable ease_


## [TooToo2]( https://pushme-pullyou.github.io/tootoo2/examples/tootoo2-r1.html )


## Concept

The [GitHub web site]( https://github.com ) allows you to do many wonderful things.

Nonetheless it would be nice to have more including features such as the following:

* View HTML, Markdown format files as rendered web pages
* Browse the contents of many files on GitHub really quickly
	* Move to the next file using only a single click
	* Views files as rendered or as source code
* Edit any file on GitHub

It would also be nice to do these things and have the code still be understandable by an entry level programmer


### Mission

* View HTML files as rendered web pages
* Browse the contents of many files on GitHub really quickly
	* Move to the next file using only a single click
	* Views files as rendered or as source code
* To demonstrate that the GitHub API is accessible by beginner to intermediate coders
* To demonstrate that you can do many nice things with the GitHub API without having to use a server or a terminal window or localhost
* To enable you to see what your peeps have been working on and playing with
* Encourage you to edit any file on GitHub
* Code written in pure vanilla simple JavaScript
* Few external dependencies
* Easy enough to learn what's going on in a day or so


### Vision

* Find even more ways of showing more fun things to do with coding and sharing


## Features

### Basic Version

* Copy to any folder available via GitHub pages
* Automagically identifies the user and repo and creates a menu with libks to all folders and files in the repo

### Select Version

* Creates breadcrumbs and tree menu with data accessed via the GitHub Developer API

### All versions

* Click three bars( 'hamburger' ) icon to slide menu in or out
* Edit button takes you to source code file on githug
* Next and previous buttons allow for fast file browsing
* Currently selected file is highlighted in the menu
* Direct link to this read me file
* Click on title to reload
* Breadcrumb menu enables folder navigation
* Hamburger menu facilitates viewing on small devices
