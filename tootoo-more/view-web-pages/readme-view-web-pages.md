Sponsor Links
====

On the Building Simulation 2017 web site, the [Sponsors Page]( http://www.buildingsimulation2017.org/sponsors.html ) provides links to the web sites of the forty sponsors,

Which are the best sites? Which sites might have something you are interested in?

The normal work flow is - one at a time- to click forty links and create forty tabs and then delete the forty tabs.

Can't we think about a better faster, easier way of viewing foty links

Can't things be like TV where you can blitz throught the channels?

That's why we built the menu on the left.

First click on any logo in the menu on the left. The click on the left and right arrows.

A fresh window pops up for each web site - replacing the previous web site. 

You can have a glance at all forty sites in a minute or so. Instead of wasting time getting there, you can enjoy being there.

The separate window thing is a bit of a hassle, but it has everything to do with security and preventing malware and spoofing activity.

The source for grabbing we used to capture the data is on GitHub.
