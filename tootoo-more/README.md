[TooToo More Read me]( #README.md )
====
_Drive GitHub faster files an hour_

Toys for TooToo to play with

Given that the TooToo8 read me is a template, this read me is where actual updates and dev notes are kept.

## Concept

### Issues / The problem that needs solving

You have problems that need solving. Helpful material may be available on the Internet. The Internet is very big. Your time is very short.

The fastest way of acquiring perceptions is by reading. Tools that help you access and process large amounts of content on the Internet may help you solve your problems faster, more easily and with less effort. 

### Mission

* Browse and view many files on GitHub with remarkable ease
* Traverse, select and display as many folders and files as possible in the shortest amount of time
* Single click or single action to get to the next item you want to see 
* Buttons for: Edit this page, ~~Next page~~, ~~Previous page~~
* Know where you are. Menus with current selection highlighted

 

* Single index.html
*	 Handles opening and displaying any and all files in sub-folders and wherever

* Single main menu
	* Written in Markdown
* All scripts must be able to run standalone and within an iframe
	* Menus must be able to appear in both states
* SubMenus on the right
	* So as not to interfere with TooToo menus
* Multiple sub folders
	* All files accessible from main menu
* Multiple scripts
	* Content may be Markdown of HTML in an iframe
*	 Menus can be markdown or HTML in an iframe
	* Allows menus to behave like dialog boxes
* Multiple sub menus
* Scripts loaded at run time
* Multiple Read Mes
	* Every folder can have its own read me
* All hosted as static files on GitHub/Bl.ocks.org/Glitch or wherever

### Vision

* Explore new ways of storing and visualizing content
* Just-in-time learning. Become a knowledge DJ. Perception enhancer
