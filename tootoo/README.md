## Concept

The [GitHub web site]( https://github.com ) allows you to do many things.

Nonetheless it would be nice to have more including features such as the following:

* View HTML, Markdown format files as rendered web pages
* Browse the contents of many files on GitHub really quickly
	* Move to the next file using only a single click
	* Views files as rendered or as source code
* Edit any file on GitHub

It would also be nice to do these things and still be understandable by an entry level programmer


### Mission

* View HTML files as rendered web pages
* Browse the contents of many files on GitHub really quickly
	* Move to the next file using only a single click
	* Views files as rendered or as source code
* To demonstrate that the GitHub API is accessible by beginner to intermediate coders
* To demonstrate that you can do many nice things with the GitHub API without having to use a server or a terminal window or localhost
* To enable you to see what your peeps have been working on and playing with
* Encourage you to edit any file on GitHub
* Code written in pure vanilla simple JavaScript
* Few external dependencies
* Easy enough to learn what's going on in a day or so


### Vision

* Find even more ways of showing more fun things to do with coding and sharing


## Features

* Makes a single call to the GitHub API for each GitHub user
	* Therefore is stingy about GitHub rate limit usage
* Select GitHub users and repos from a drop down list
* Creates breadcrumbs and tree menu with data accessed via the GitHub Developer API
* Enter the name of a GitHub user you know in the input box
* Display rendered file contents with a single click
* Click three bars( 'hamburger' ) icon to slide menu in or out
* Direct link to this read me file
* Click on title to reload


## Issues



## Goals / To Do

* 2017-03-05 ~ make user/repo input box work
* 2017-03-05 ~ Go back / history - needs full location hash
* 2017-02-28 ~ Update contents position upon resize
	* Ugh - Needs to adjust for each file type
* 2017-02-27 ~ Add handlers for STL files
* 2016-11-30 ~ Better handling of current file data for HTML etc
* 2016-11-30 ~ Material Design Light version


### Maybe / Needs more thought

* 2016-11-30 ~ Go to next previous file using cursor keys or not??
* 2016-12-01 ~ Overlay or plugin to display issues in right column

## Users

[Leader Photos]( https://leaderphotos.github.io/tootoo/r2/tootoo-r2-leader-photos.html )
* Has custom gallery page feature
