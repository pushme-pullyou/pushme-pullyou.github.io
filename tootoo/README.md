## Concept

The GitHub web site allows you to do many things.

Nonetheless it would be nice to have more including features such as the following:

* View HTML files as rendered web pages
* Browse the contents of many files on GitHub really quickly
	* Move to the next file using only a single click
	* Views files as rendered or as source code

### Mission

* View HTML files as rendered web pages
* Browse the contents of many files on GitHub really quickly
	* Move to the next file using only a single click
	* Views files as rendered or as source code
* To demonstrate that the GitHub API is accessible by beginner to intermediate coders
* To demonstrate that you can do many nice things with the GitHub API without having to use a server or a terminal window or localhost
* To enable you to see what your peeps have been working on and playing with



### Vision

* Find even more ways of showing more fun things to do with coding and sharing


## Features

* TBD
* Select GitHub users and repos from a drop down list
* Creates breadcrumbs and tree menu with data accessed via the GitHub Developer API
* Enter the name of a GitHub user you know in the input box
* Display rendered file contents with a single click
* Click three bars( 'hamburger' ) icon to slide menu in or out
* Direct link to this read me file
* Click on title to reload
