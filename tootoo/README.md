## Concept

The [GitHub web site]( https://github.com ) allows you to do many wonderful things.

Nonetheless it would be nice to have more including features such as the following:

* View HTML, Markdown format files as rendered web pages
* Browse the contents of many files on GitHub really quickly
	* Move to the next file using only a single click
	* Views files as rendered or as source code
* Edit any file on GitHub

It would also be nice to do these things and have the code still be understandable by an entry level programmer


### Mission

* View HTML files as rendered web pages
* Browse the contents of many files on GitHub really quickly
	* Move to the next file using only a single click
	* Views files as rendered or as source code
* To demonstrate that the GitHub API is accessible by beginner to intermediate coders
* To demonstrate that you can do many nice things with the GitHub API without having to use a server or a terminal window or localhost
* To enable you to see what your peeps have been working on and playing with
* Encourage you to edit any file on GitHub
* Code written in pure vanilla simple JavaScript
* Few external dependencies
* Easy enough to learn what's going on in a day or so


### Vision

* Find even more ways of showing more fun things to do with coding and sharing
