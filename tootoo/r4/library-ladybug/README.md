## Concept

### Issues / Problems that need solving
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as summarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

When you are testing Ladybug Tools, you want to be able to call up and display a good number of files very quickly. This script helps you spot bugs and errors more quickly.



### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* TBD

### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* TBD


## Features

* A [file viewer]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_viewer ) for all the Ladybug Tools files hosted on GitHub
* Display the catalog of file names in menu using a [tree view]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_view ) and other methods
* When you clicks a file name in the menu, the file contents are displayed in the contents panel

### Maintaining

More likely to be Always fresh
* Build your web site pages with either HTML or Markdown
* Edit pages on the fly using the GitHub editor
* Edit locally using your favorite IDE/editor with full revision and contribution  control
* Edit your content any time anywhere


Collaboration
* Multiple contributors
* Easy for the non-technically minded.

Increase ways to communicate
* Design changes are simple.
	* Single style sheet and HTML template for all the repos
* SEO friendly?
	* SEO-friendly URLs

Consistent brand management
* Same style, same tools, same templates across repos


Secure and reliable
* Deal with issues using GitHub issues
* Unmatched support
	* Our peeps plus watchers plus Github team

Easy to localize/translate
* Full Unicode support

Interaction
* Add iframes, forms, embedded code

### Coding
* Entry level, plain-vanilla JavaScript
* Only dependencies relate to content viewing
	* Turning Markdown into HTML
* Roughly just a thousand lines of code
* Devops, full-stack, computer-science degree: welcome but not needed
* Node and npm: not needed ( and not yet implemented ;-)
* Screams 'play with me'
* Mobile ready
* Waiting for Material UI
* Shared resources?
* Data automation?
* FOSS

### Testing/Debugging?

### File Handling
* Updates file catalog at run time.
	* Uses GitHub API to gather list of files and folders
* Location of script is independent of files being catalogued and displayed
	* Script runs locally or from server

### Performance
* Small size
* Files served off Rawgit CDN

### Menus


### Repo listings
* Every repo displayed in the viewer has its own parameters file
* The parameters files allows you to
	* Set the branch, path, default file, tag line and more
	* Define you own menu
	* Update broken relative links to absolute links


### File Catalogs
* Multiple available methods for displaying the catalog for files
* Update catalog display type at run-time
* Current types include
	* Table of Contents: human curated menu, written in Markdown
	* All Files: familiar tree view with folder names up top and file names below
	* Folders and File: screen dump of the list of all he paths
	* Folder Groups: Display list of all folder paths with file names displayed below
	* List by folders: all files in catalog with folder names as separator
	* Alphabetical: Index of all files, numbered and in 'abc' order

### Content Display
* Display rendered HTML and Markdown
* Displays images as images
* Displays code in Ace editor container
* Every page has an 'Edit' button that takes you to the GitHub source code for that page
* Every page has 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons

### Theme
* Update User Interface at runtime
* Small selection of updatable elements included

### User Interaction
* Click three bars( 'hamburger' ) icon to slide menu in or out
* Direct link to this read me file
* Click on title to reload
