## Shopping Goals

Concentrate on ingredients are
* Readily available, reasonably priced
* Fresh, organic, without additives,
* Low sodium, high protein

Ingredients or products available at my local Safeway (or by Safeway delivery).

Shop every two or three days (my local Safeway is across the street).

Food should be from the outside walls of the supermarket - fresh and perishable.

Everything is eaten. No food is thrown away.
