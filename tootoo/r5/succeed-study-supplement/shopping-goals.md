## Shopping Goals

Concentrate on ingredients that are:
* Readily available, reasonably priced
* Fresh, organic, without additives
* Low sodium, high protein

Ingredients or products available at my local Safeway (or by Safeway delivery).

Shop every two or three days (my local Safeway is across the street).

Food should be from the outside walls of the supermarket - fresh and perishable.

Everything is eaten. No food is thrown away.


## Hints

* Look at the expiry dates
* Look at the nutrition infobox of everything
* Carry a market bag
* Order online and go to the store
* Short frequent trips to the market - helps with getting more walking
