Advertise 5,000,000 food items

A search for 'Green Giant Steamers Healthy Vision' gives 10,000 nearly duplicate results. I did not find one with correct product information.

Suugestion

All foods should have an internationally recognized bar code, qr code, and ID number

Web sites provide pertinent data for the IDs

Web sites are provided by producers, organizations, private peeps whatever. The key thing

Doh! every product has a UPC!

Using Google, After several false leads, wow.

Need to build a spreadsheet or something where

One worksheet allows entry of UPC - which then goes and fetches data
Second worksheet allows daily entry of data with a few clicks per item


cereal + salsa - 1/2 veg 1 grain
healthy vision = 2 veg
brown rice = 3 grain
guacamole = 1 veg
carrots = 1 veg
salad + salsa = 2 veg
nuts 3 oz?
