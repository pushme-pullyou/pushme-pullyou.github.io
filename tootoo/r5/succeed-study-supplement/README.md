_Not connected with UCSF. Just looking for good-tasting, filling, nutritious food_


## Concept

### Issues / Problems that need solving
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as summarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

28% of households have just one person.

Most cookbooks help you plan meals for two, four or more people

If you are fully employed, living by yourself and have an active life, then spending an hour a day preparing meals is out of thee question.

Many recipes anticipate that you wil spend ten minutes or more preparing a dish. This time along with washing up and shopping can easily mount up to twenty to thirty minutes per meal. Doing that two or three times a day can severely limit other activities you may be interested in

You would like to eat in a healthy way and therefore you need to know the nutritional content of food. Very few restauants provide any nutritional data let alone complete data. And just because the sign says there 500 mg of salt does not stop the chef from putting 1000 mg ib the dishes that happened to arrive at your table

Eating at home is the only real way of keeping track of what you are eating. And this sure can be lonely and boring.

Any time you grill, boil, broil or bake and any time you spend chopping, dicing or shredding you are increasing prep time and wash-up time.

Feeling hungry is no fun. Finding food that fills you up can be difficult. For example, in the frozen foods sections there my be hundreds of prepared meals available. The great majority have serving sized between six to nine ounces. This portion size may be adequate if you weigh 90 pounds but will leave you feeling famished if you weigh twice that amount. Using two packages almost always mean you will go over the op in terms of salt, fat, sugars and more
