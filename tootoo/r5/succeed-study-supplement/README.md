My name is Theo Armour. I am the writer of these pages and a participant in the study described below.


## Survivor Choices for Eating and Drinking - Colorectal Cancer (SUCCEED)

###  Purpose of the Study
> Epidemiologic data suggest that a Western dietary pattern after diagnosis of colorectal cancer increases risk of disease recurrence and death. High intake of red and processed meat, dairy, refined grains, and sweets/desserts characterize a 'Western dietary pattern'. This study aims to translate the epidemiologic findings into a patient-centered, web-based dietary intervention with text messaging to inform and modify users' dietary choices. The investigators' specific aims are to: 1) Develop a web-based dietary intervention with text messaging for colorectal cancer survivors; and 2) Conduct a 12-week pilot randomized controlled trial to determine the acceptability and feasibility of the dietary intervention among 50 colorectal cancer survivors. All participants will receive standard of care print materials regarding diet following a colorectal cancer diagnosis. Participants in the intervention group will also receive access to a web-based dietary intervention with text messaging for 12 weeks. This study will generate preliminary data on the effect of the intervention on dietary choices among colorectal cancer survivors for future studies.

## Concept / Issues / Problems that need solving
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as summarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

### Reverse Intervention

The specific aim of this web presence is to develop a web-based clinical study intervention with online messaging for the research team. Fingers-crossed that reverse intervention is an OK thing for participants to carry out. If not, then tell me to shut up. ;-)

### Patterns

I am a designer of buildings, software, a happy life, whatever. Looking at news project, you prepare a brief: stats, anecdotes, requirements - all with a focus to desired outcomes. Here goes.

I am an elderly, disabled white male residing in San Francisco. I am not alone. There are many of us.

[28% of households in the US have just one person]( http://www.ipsnews.net/2017/02/the-rise-of-one-person-households/ ).

[The older you are the more you are by yourself]( https://www.theatlas.com/charts/HJFYm4uQ- )

The ingredient acquisition, food preparation, consumption and cleanup patterns that works so well for the traditional nuclear family does no apply to us

Here are some anecdotal observations*

Most cookbooks help you plan meals for two, four or more people

If you are fully employed, living by yourself and have an active life, then spending an hour a day preparing meals is out of the question.

Many recipes anticipate that you spend ten minutes or more preparing a dish. This time along with the time for washing up and shopping can easily mount up to twenty to thirty minutes per meal. Doing that two or three times a day can severely limit other activities you may be interested in

You would like to eat in a healthy manner and therefore you need to know the nutritional content of food. Very few restaurants provide any nutritional data let alone complete data. And just because the sign says there 500 mg of salt does not stop the chef from putting 1000 mg ib the dishes that happened to arrive at your table.

Eating at home is the only real way of keeping track of what you are eating. And this sure can be lonely and boring.

Any time you grill, boil, broil or bake and any time you spend chopping, dicing or shredding you are increasing prep time and wash-up time.

Feeling hungry is no fun. Finding food that fills you up can be difficult. For example, in the frozen foods sections there my be hundreds of prepared meals available. The great majority have serving sized between six to nine ounces. This portion size may be adequate if you weigh 90 pounds but will leave you feeling famished if you weigh twice that amount. Using two packages almost always mean you will go over the op in terms of salt, fat, sugars and more

If the peeps of my cohort are to eat food that helps with post-cancer survival then we need to come up with guidelines well-suited to our new needs.


### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* We mostly acquire food ingredients from supermarkets
	* Identify specific products from supermarkets that are OK to eat.
	* Going to farmers markets takes too long
	* When ordered online or when food is delivered, it's usually from supermarkets
* Food preparation has to be speedy
	* Identify tasty nutritious dishes that can be prepared in three minutes or less
	* Microwaves, electric kettles and toasters are your friends
	* Ovens, baking dishes, sauce pans not so much
* Cleanup must be minimal
	* Come with cooking methods so that dishes that may prepared in the dishes they will be eaten in.
	* After you clean the grease off a pan a few times, you may begin not to cook things that create that sort of grease
* Getting the data is an ongoing process
	* Identify safe eating limits - both minimums and maximums
	* Identify ways of testing and verifying results
	* Identify authoritative source of information and data
	* Acquiring data regarding the nutritional value of food products is improving quite rapidly



### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* Eating is fun, healthy and easy
