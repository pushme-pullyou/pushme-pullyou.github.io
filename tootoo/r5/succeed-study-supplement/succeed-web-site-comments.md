## Set Goals

> Eat 3 or more servings of whole grains every day.

I can understand eating whole grains in preference to eating white bread and other starches.

But I do not understand the push for eating whole grains if you are getting your carbs through vegetables, nuts with a portion or two of rice per day



## Track

You should not have to press the save button. Whatever you click should be the value. It should not take 24 clicks to fill in one day of date - plus six more clicks to double check all the values


## Eat Well

### Main Page
> We recommend 6 dietary changes (or maintaining these dietary habits if you already do them). All 6 eating and drinking habits have been linked with a lower risk of colorectal cancer recurrence, and they are also beneficial for your overall health.

Where are the links or references? Under what authority do you make these pronouncements?

### Recipes

All the recipes look delicious and healthy

Of the 33 recipes, almost all are for 2, 4, 6 or more servings. I count only two that say they could be ine serving

All seem to require significant amounts of cleaning, chopping and preparation

None of the recipes provides nutritional information

Notes and tips provides credits but as text only not links.

A number of titles in the recipes use underlines. Underlining in web pages usually indicates the text works as a link to another page. Use of underlining when text is not a hyperlink should be avoided - especially when the elderly are involved,

### Submit a recipe

The form has boxes for title and directions, but no boxes for ingredients or notes

> Our study dietician will review your recipe submissions, and if they meet our dietary recommendations as well as other general health guidelines, we will post the recipes for everyone in the SUCCEED community.

What are your health guidelines? Are they a secret? A link to your guidelines would be very nice - and quite useful for many of us.

BTW, I clicked the 'submit' button but had not filled anything in. Nonetheless I received a message: 'Thank you, your submission has been received.'

## Meal Planning

> Plan your meals, snacks, and beverages for the week.

Nice idea, but a lot of the products I buy have short expiry dates and supermarkets are not always the best at keeping fresh products on the shelf. All the salads and fresh veggies are pre-washed. The choice of what I buy very much depends on the expiray date of the product which I can only tell on the day when I am actually in the market


### Example meals

All four dishes look lovely and delicious.

How much time did it take to prepare all four meals? My guess is that it would take an hour. (I have only one hand so it would take me even more time, but nevermind ). If you add the cleanup and shopping, this might come to ten hours or so per week.

There's everything right about these recipes. And there can be ideas for things that are good to eat that can ne prepared in a jiffy.

Measures in metric system?

> By July 2018, the amount of added sugars in a food will be listed on the Nutrition Facts label.


6. What are probiotics/prebiotics, and should I include these in my diet?

> Research in animals suggests probiotics and prebiotics may be beneficial for preventing colorectal cancer, but more research in humans is needed. Until more is known, probiotic/prebiotic dietary supplements should be avoided. Obtain probiotics and prebiotics through a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nonfat plain yogurt, nuts, and legumes.

But the
