Spider helps you with building your presence on the Web. Spiders are good with webs, you know. The web presence we want to help you build is your building presentation web presence. Yup, the webs are wrapped up in buildings here. I'm getting confused too. Maybe I'll just look at the pictures. 

Earlier versions of the scripts are at [Ladybug Web]( http://www.ladybug.tools/ladybug-web/ ).


2017-10-28 ~ Got sidetracked for a while:

## Full Screen build release: [Build Well]( http://ladybug-tools.github.io/spider/build-well/index.html )

## Full Screen dev release: [Build Well]( http://ladybug-tools.github.io/spider/build-well/dev/index.html )

2017-08-25 ~ This site is still in its infancy. Much will be added, but for the moment our priorities are concentrated on a very hot topic:

## [Burning mAnalemma 2017]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/burning-manalemma-2017/ )
