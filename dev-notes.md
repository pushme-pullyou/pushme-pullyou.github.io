From PaulM on GubGub

I really like seeing all the repository blurbs in the middle. Good overview of what someone is thinking on GitHub.

The “List of Favorites” might have an entry underneath to refresh the list in the box down below it. I had to refresh the entire page to figure out where it went. The “List of Favorites” should really look and function like the nearby entries in its own box.

Repositories without a master branch are giving errors: need to look at gh-pages as well, independent of whether the respository is the main github.io one.

Not all recent activity shows content. Can you provide more previews of some sort, so that all activity has a preview area? I think it also might be better to open these links in a new window or tab.
