On the Building Simulation 2017 web site, the [Sponsors Page]( http://www.buildingsimulation2017.org/sponsors.html ) provides links to the web sites of the forty sponsors,

Which are the best sites? Which sites might have something you are interested in?

The normal work flow is - one at a time- to click forty links and create forty tabs and then delete the forty tabs.

Can't we think about a better faster, easier way of viewing forty links?

Can't things be like TV where you can blitz through the channels? We want forty links in forty winks.

That's why we built the sponnsor link script.

* [Sponsor links]( #menu-sponsor-links.md "View all 40 sites in a minute or two" )

Click on any logo in the menu on the left. Then click on the left and right arrows.

A fresh window pops up for each web site - replacing the previous web site. 

You can have a glance at all forty sites in a minute or so. Instead of wasting time getting there, you can enjoy being there.

The separate window thing is a bit of a hassle, but it has everything to do with security and preventing malware and spoofing activity.

The script works on a mobile device. Unfortunately, you must hit the go back / previous page button each with each new site.

The source code for grabbing we used to capture the data is on [GitHub]( https://github.com/ibpsa2017/ibpsa2017.github.io/tree/master/sponsor-links ).

Which sites do you think are the the most effective?
