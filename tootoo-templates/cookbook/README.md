## Concept


### Coding Style

These scripts here are [cookbook]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookbook#Usage_outside_the_world_of_food ) style example code

The scripts are intended to help with rapid iteration of simple code edits. For example, choosing a pretty color or selecting a pleasing length may require the viewing of dozens of 'fails' involving editing the code, changing a number, saving it, refreshing the browser, and judging the results.

Until there is an AI debugger for ugliness, the path toward a beautiful user experience is paved with the coder's fails.

Here we use a variety of strategies in order to get up to speed at faster fails per hour.

The tricks include:

* Make the code a readable as possible
	* Avoid using symbols such as ~~ or => that requires extra mental processing
	* Make the code as much as possible like reading a line of English prose
* Use a variety of color to indicate that adjacent and connected elements are actually separate elements
* If a feature creates an element then display that element immediately and in a distinguishable manner.
	* You should not have to click to see if something is actually there
* Enable viewing everything upon loading
	* use transparency and 'exploding' element positions
* Allow as much possible user interaction as possible
	* Cookbook examples are places where you find out what crashes your app
	* Will your script survive a user entering negative numbers?
	* Can things get too big or small or invisible and come back and still be usable?
	* Preventing users from entering invalid data is a very separate issue
		* And we need to provide some cookbook examples of helping you input useful data
* Do not apply fixes for particular operating systems
	* Try to make code easier and faster to read / avoid thinking about complications / grasp the essence
	* Example: issues with iframes on Apple mobile devices
	* Example: wide lines on Widows OS with certain browsers

### Files

All the examples here are standalone files.

They follow the Three.js examples: https://threejs.org/examples/

* All HTML, CSS and JavaScript - apart from library files - are in a single HTML file
