* Basic html templates with sliding menu, css selection, markdown capability and frequently used pages
* No dependencies apart from CSS files

	* You can also hotlink the themes via CDN at BootstrapCDN

### Code
* Everything - HTML/CSS/JavaScript - in a single cookbook style file
* A few hundred lines
* Mobile first
* Simple code
* Drop in, make one ot two edits and you are good to go
