* basic html template with sliding menu, markdown capability and frequently used pages
* No dependencies apart from CSS files
* Bootswatch: Free themes for Bootstrap
* Using the themes is as easy as downloading a CSS file and replacing the one that comes with Bootstrap.
* You can also hotlink the themes via CDN at BootstrapCDN
