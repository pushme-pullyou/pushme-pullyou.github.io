## Naming Convention

The names of the scripts here are derived the the names of characters in Hugh Lofting's [Dr Dolittle]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Dolittle ) series of children's books.

See: [List of Doctor Dolittle characters]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Dolittle_characters )

### The pushmi-pullyu

_The pushmi-pullyu (pronounced "push-meâ€”pull-you") is a "gazelle-unicorn cross" which has two heads (one of each) at opposite ends of its body_ - Wikipedia

We use `pushMe pullYou` instead of `pushmi-pullyu`.

The reference is based on the coincidence that much of the usage of Git is based on the process of pulling and pushing data to and fro a server.

### Gub-Gub
Gub-Gub is Doctor Dolittle's pet pig.

### Dab-Dab
Dab-Dab is Doctor Dolittle's pet duck.

### Too-Too
