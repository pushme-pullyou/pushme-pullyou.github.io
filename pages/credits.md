Thank you [Ben]( https://github.com/bwelle ) and [Anton]( https://github.com/antonszilasi ) and [Chien Si]( https://github.com/chiensiTB ) for initiating the Build Well and gbXML Viewer effort - and to [Mostapha]( https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari ) for guidance in even bigger efforts

Thank you [Michal]( https://github.com/mdengusiak ) for your highly visual insights and feedback - essential to developing a well-tested 3D world ( virtual and/or as built ;-)
