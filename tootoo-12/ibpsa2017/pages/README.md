The International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) is a non-profit international society of building performance simulation researchers, developers and practitioners, dedicated to improving the built environment.

This is an unofficial site created by and for Building Simulation 2017 conference attendees.

## At least three agendas

The initial intent of this GitHub organization was to:

1. Be a place where conference attendees could post and share material and comments
	* See [Simulating Building Simulation]( https://github.com/ibpsa2017/ibpsa2017.github.io/issues/3 )
2. Be a place where scripts useful to attendees could be hosted
	* See [Conference agenda catalog in a single page]( https://github.com/ibpsa2017/ibpsa2017.github.io/issues/4 )
3. Host the source code for the material to be presented a one of the conference sessions
	* See [Introduction to Open Web Tools Miniworkshop]( https://github.com/ibpsa2017/ibpsa2017.github.io/issues/5 )

Ultimately, only a single attendee contributed material during the conference. So it goes.



## Introduction to Open Web Tools Miniworkshop

The map of all the items covered in the Open Web Tools Miniworkshop would be larger that the workshop itself.

In the interest of brevity, Theo Armour provides a list of ten things covered in his presentation:

* GitHub and GitHub Pages are wonderful places to host and share material for _ad hoc_ events such as conferences and short projects 
* Anything can be simulated [hacked] - including conferences...
* Where will the Sun be is a very old question
* Current responses are to be found everywhere under the Sun - including the app store
* Code is surprisingly idiosyncratic
* Even good code may have incomprehensible variables and other insane quirks
* EPW files are amazing. Getting them is another issue
* EPW files in JSON format hosted in readily accessible manner are wonderful
* What we can do in 3D with code that uses the GPU is amazing
* We must leave the paper world behind and do data viz in new ways
* We can exaggerate, show more variable interacting and make insights occur more frequently

_2017-08-13 ~ the above list is still a work in progress_

## Subsequent Efforts

The current efforts are attempts by Theo Armour to complete the incomplete demos he showed during the workshop

When this effort is complete, then further efforts are likely to continue somewhere on the Ladybug Tools GitHub organization


## Change Log

### 2017-08-13 ~ Theo

* This read me updated and reset to be the developer notes for the project not that the GitHub Pages wen site home page is set up as a blog
