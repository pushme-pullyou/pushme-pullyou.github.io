Result of old-timey academic versus contemporary web Wave phone

Lemons into lemonade. let's look behind the curtain, let me make snarky comments

## A dilemma of analemmas

Example: Bring daily Sun path calculations anywhere in the world down to a human level

Let's start a few billion years ago

Analemma: combination of Earth's 23.5 degree tilt and its slightly elliptical orbit combine to generate this figure "8" pattern of 

## Want fast, easy simple

In your browswer an any device


## Where is the Sun going to be?

Is this the oldest calculation? Is there any oder that we know about?

And we throw our best technology finding answerings

## Today Sun position is an app

Many fun apps - mostly closed source, unverifiable and with little data sharing


## Source code: lots of it

Calculate Solar path - in just about any language under the Sun


## Looked at 3 JavaScript scripts

Leaflet, D3, NOA

Looking at other peoples code is so much fun.

All fine, but all with idiosyncrasies


## Agafonkin: SunCalc.js



## Bostock: Solar Calculator



## NOAA: Solar Calculator



## Code Sample


my code was almost as silly


## Shadow Range Calcs & More

What some are doing is rediculously fasy
